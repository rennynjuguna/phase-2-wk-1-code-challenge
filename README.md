# Bank of Flatiron

The Bank of Flatiron shows the Transactions obtained from the db.json file

## Setup

After unbundling the project:

Run `npm install` in your terminal.

Run `npm run server` This will run your backend on port 8001. (This can be edited in the package.json file)

In a new terminal, run npm start. This will run your React app on port 8000.

Open http://localhost:8001/transactions in the browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The app also uses Semantic UI for styling which is installed using `npm install semantic-ui-css`
